# About This Course

## Welcome

This course is an in-depth exploration of the fundamentals of Web
Development. We will be covering a variety of topics ranging from basic
programming technologies to designing and hosting custom web pages.

Before we dive into the core topics of these courses, we'll first need to
get your computer (your _local environment_) set up for writing and running
code in JavaScript and Ruby. You'll be running code via a terminal on your
computer, so we'll also go through the basics of the command-line interface.

After this, we'll introduce Git, GitHub and the concept of version control,
essential for storing your prograrmming work in this course and beyond.

With these topics covered, we will dive into the technologies behind every
modern website - HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These three are best understood in
conjunction, so the goal is to introduce just enough of each that you will be
able to use them together to build websites entirely from scratch.

At the end of this course, you'll have the skills you need to build and host
websites for whatever you'd like!
